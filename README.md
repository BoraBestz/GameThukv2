## 1. Introduction

GameThuk  is a web application designed to aggregate and track video game information from multiple online sources. Utilizing web scraping techniques implemented in Python, it collects and processes game data which is then served via a REST API. The frontend, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for browsing game details.

The main goal of this project is to develop an automated system that helps gamers easily search, explore, and stay updated with the latest game releases and reviews all in one place.

## 2. Objectives

- Develop a web application that automatically gathers game data from various external websites  
- Display detailed game information including titles, cover images, release dates, ratings, and descriptions  
- Design a modern, intuitive UI using Next.js and Tailwind CSS to enhance user experience  
- Implement a RESTful API backend using Python for scalable and maintainable data management  
- Demonstrate full-stack development skills combining frontend, backend, and data processing

## 3. Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend & Scraping:** Python (with libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests)  
- **API:** RESTful API built with Flask or FastAPI  
- **State Management:** Redux for managing frontend state  
- **Others:** Node.js, npm/yarn, Git for version control

## 4. System Architecture

The system is composed of three main parts:  

1. **Web Scraper:** Python scripts that crawl target game websites, extract relevant data, and store it in a database or serve it via API.  
2. **Backend API:** A RESTful service that provides endpoints to query and deliver game data to the frontend.  
3. **Frontend:** Next.js application that fetches data from the backend and renders interactive pages for users to browse, search, and view game details.
